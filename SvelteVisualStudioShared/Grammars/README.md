# Grammars 

This directory contains TextMate syntax highlight grammars for TypeScript, CSS and svelte. 

## Credit

The syntax highlight for TypeScript and CSS is adopted from [vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode). And they were generated from upstream repositories [microsoft/TypeScript-TmLanguage](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-TmLanguage) and [atom/language-css](https://github.com/atom/language-css) respectively.

The syntax highlight for svelte is forked from [sveltejs/language-tools](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/tree/d0950e6b024e46b62e23324ea7ef92a16fe18924). It's the classic version originally authored by [James Birtles](https://github.com/jamesbirtles).
